            longest-living people in the world
        </h1>
        <p>WHEN WE STARTED working on this book, we didn’t want to just research the factors that contribute to a long
            and
            happy life; we wanted to hear from the true masters of this art.</p>
        <p>The interviews we conducted in Okinawa merit their own chapter, but in the
            section that precedes it we have provided an overview of the life philosophies of
            a few international champions of longevity. We’re talking about
            supercentenarians—people who live to 110 years of age or more.
        </p>
        <p>The term was coined in 1970 by Norris McWhirter, editor of The Guinness
            Book of World Records. Its use became more widespread in the 1990s, after it
            appeared in William Strauss and Neil Howe’s Generations. Today there are an
            estimated 300 to 450 supercentenarians in the world, although the age of only
            around 75 of them has been confirmed. They aren’t superheroes, but we could see
            them as such for having spent far more time on this planet than the average life
            expectancy would predict.
        </p>
        <p>Given the rise in life expectancy around the world, the number of
            supercentenarians might also increase. A healthy and purposeful life could help
            us join their ranks.</p>
        <p>Let’s take a look at what a few of them have to say.</p>

        <h2>Misao Okawa (117)
        </h2>
        <p>“Eat and sleep, and you’ll live a long time. You have to learn to
            relax.”</p>
        <p>According to the Gerontology Research Group, until April 2015, the oldest living
            person in the world was Misao Okawa, who passed away in a care facility in
            Osaka, Japan, after living for 117 years and 27 days.
        </p>
        <p>The daughter of a textile merchant, she was born in 1898, when Spain lost its
            colonies in Cuba and the Philippines, and the United States annexed Hawaii and
            launched Pepsi-Cola. Until she was 110, this woman—who lived in three
            different centuries—cared for herself unassisted.</p>
        <p>When specialists asked about her self-care routine, Misao answered simply,
            “Eating sushi and sleeping,” to which we should add, having a tremendous thirst
            for life. When they inquired about her secret for longevity, she answered with a
            smile, “I ask myself the same thing.”</p>
        <p>Proof that Japan continues to be a factory of long life: In July of the same year
            Sakari Momoi passed away at 112 years and 150 days old. At the time he was the
            oldest man in the world, though he was younger than fifty-seven women.</p>
        <h2>María Capovilla (116)</h2>
        <p>“I’ve never eaten meat in my life.”</p>
        <p>Born in Ecuador in 1889, María Capovilla was recognized by Guinness as the
            world’s oldest person. She died of pneumonia in 2006, at 116 years and 347 days
            old, leaving behind three children, twelve grandchildren, and twenty great-and
            great-great-grandchildren.
        </p>
        <p>She gave one of her last interviews at age 107, sharing her memories and her
            thoughts:</p>
        <p>I’m happy, and I give thanks to God, who keeps me going. I never thought I’d live so long, I thought I’d
            die long ago. My husband, Antonio Capovilla, was the captain of a ship. He passed away at 84. We had
            two daughters and a son, and now I have many grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</p>
        <p>Things were better, back in the old days. People behaved better. We used to dance, but we were
            more restrained; there was this one song I loved dancing to: “María” by Luis Alarcón. I still remember
            most of the words. I also remember many prayers, and say them every day.</p>
        <p>I like the waltz, and can still dance it. I also still make crafts, I still do some of the things I did when
            I was in school</p>
        <p>When she had finished recalling her past, she began to dance—one of her
            great passions—with an energy that made her seem decades younger.
        </p>
        <p>When asked about her secret for longevity, she responded simply, “I don’t
            know what the secret to long life is. The only thing I do is I’ve never eaten meat in
            my life. I attribute it to that.”</p>
        <h2>Jeanne Calment (122)</h2>
        <p>“Everything’s fine.”</p>
        <p>Born in Arles, France, in February 1875, Jeanne Calment lived until August 4,
            1997, making her, at 122, the oldest person of verified age in history. She
            jokingly said that she “competed with Methuselah,” and there is no question that
            she broke numerous records as she went on celebrating birthdays.
        </p>
        <p>She died of natural causes at the end of a happy life during which she denied
            herself almost nothing. She rode a bicycle until she turned 100. She lived on her
            own until 110, when she agreed to move into a nursing home after accidentally
            starting a small fire in her apartment. She stopped smoking at 120, when her
            cataracts started making it hard for her to bring a cigarette to her lips.
        </p>
        <p>One of her secrets may have been her sense of humor. As she said on her
            120th birthday, “I see badly, I hear badly, and I feel bad, but everything’s fine.”</p>
        <h2>Walter Breuning (114)</h2>
        <p>“If you keep your mind and body busy, you’ll be around a long
            time.”
        </p>
        <p>Born in Minnesota in 1896, Walter Breuning was able to see three centuries in his
            lifetime. He died in Montana in 2011, from natural causes; he’d had two wives
            and a fifty-year career on the railroad. At eighty-three he retired to an assisted
            living center in Montana, where he remained until his death. He is the second-oldest man (of verified age)
            ever
            born in the United States.
        </p>
        <p>He gave many interviews in his final years, insisting that his longevity
            stemmed from, among other things, his habit of eating only two meals per day
            and working for as many years as he could. “Your mind and your body. You keep
            both busy,” he said on his 112th birthday, “you’ll be here a long time.” Back then,
            he was still exercising every day.
        </p>
        <p>Among Breuning’s other secrets: He had a habit of helping others, and he
            wasn’t afraid of dying. As he declared in a 2010 interview with the Associated
            Press, “We’re all going to die. Some people are scared of dying. Never be afraid
            to die. Because you’re born to die.”</p>
        <p>Before passing away in 2011, he is said to have told a pastor that he’d made a
            deal with God: If he wasn’t going to get better, it was time to go.</p>
