        <h2>What is logotherapy?</h2>
        <p>A colleague once asked Viktor Frankl to define his school of psychology in a
            single phrase, to which Frankl replied, “Well, in logotherapy the patient sits up
            straight and has to listen to things that are, on occasion, hard to hear.” The
            colleague had just described psychoanalysis to him in the following terms: “In
            psychoanalysis, the patient lies down on a couch and tells you things that are, on
            occasion, hard to say.”</p>
        <p>Frankl explains that one of the first questions he would ask his patients was
            “Why do you not commit suicide?” Usually the patient found good reasons not to,
            and was able to carry on. What, then, does logotherapy do?</p>
        <p>The answer is pretty clear: It helps you find reasons to live.</p>
        <p>Logotherapy pushes patients to consciously discover their life’s purpose in
            order to confront their neuroses. Their quest to fulfill their destiny then motivates
            them to press forward, breaking the mental chains of the past and overcoming
            whatever obstacles they encounter along the way.
        </p>

            <p><b>Something to Live For</b>
            </p>
            <p>A study conducted by Frankl in his Vienna clinic found that among both
                patients and personnel, around 80 percent believed that human beings
                needed a reason for living, and around 60 percent felt they had someone
                or something in their lives worth dying for.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>The search for meaning</h2>
        <p>The search for purpose became a personal, driving force that allowed Frankl to
            achieve his goals. The process of logotherapy can be summarized in these five
            steps:
        </p>
        <ol class="list">
            <li>A person feels empty, frustrated, or anxious.
            </li>
            <li>The therapist shows him that what he is feeling is the desire to have a
                meaningful life.</li>
            <li>The patient discovers his life’s purpose (at that particular point in time).</li>
            <li>Of his own free will, the patient decides to accept or reject that destiny.</li>
            <li>This newfound passion for life helps him overcome obstacles and sorrows.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Frankl himself would live and die for his principles and ideals. His
            experiences as a prisoner at Auschwitz showed him that “Everything can be taken
            from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms—to choose one’s
            attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one’s own way.”

            It was
            something he had to go through alone, without any help, and it inspired him for
            the rest of his life.</p>
