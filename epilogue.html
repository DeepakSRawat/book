    <title>Epilogue: KIGAI- The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</title>
</head>

    <h2>Epilogue</h2>
    <h1>Ikigai: The art of living</h1>
    <p>Mitsuo Aida was one of the most important calligraphers and haikuists of the
        twentieth century. He is yet another example of a Japanese person who dedicated
        his life to a very specific ikigai: communicating emotions with seventeen-syllable
        poems, using a shodo calligraphy brush.</p>
    <p>Many of Aida’s haikus philosophize about the importance of the present
        moment, and the passage of time. The poem reproduced below could be
        translated as “In the here and now, the only thing in my life is your life.”
    </p>
    <p>いまここにしかないわたし <br>
        のいのちあなたのいのち</p>
    <p>In another poem, Aida writes simply, “Here, now.” It is an artwork that seeks
        to evoke feelings of mono no aware (a melancholy appreciation of the
        ephemeral).</p>
    <p>いまここ</p>
    <p>The following poem touches on one of the secrets of bringing ikigai into our
        lives: “Happiness is always determined by your heart.”</p>
    <p>しあわせはいつも自分の心がきめる</p>
    <p>This last one, also by Aida, means “Keep going; don’t change your path.”
    </p>
    <p>そのままでいいがな</p>
    <p>Once you discover your ikigai, pursuing it and nurturing it every day will bring
        meaning to your life. The moment your life has this purpose, you will achieve a
        happy state of flow in all you do, like the calligrapher at his canvas or the chef
        who, after half a century, still prepares sushi for his patrons with love.
    </p>
    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Our ikigai is different for all of us, but one thing we have in common is that we
        are all searching for meaning. When we spend our days feeling connected to what
        is meaningful to us, we live more fully; when we lose the connection, we feel
        despair.</p>
    <p>Modern life estranges us more and more from our true nature, making it very
        easy for us to lead lives lacking in meaning. Powerful forces and incentives
        (money, power, attention, success) distract us on a daily basis; don’t let them take
        over your life.</p>
    <p>Our intuition and curiosity are very powerful internal compasses to help us
        connect with our ikigai. Follow those things you enjoy, and get away from or
        change those you dislike. Be led by your curiosity, and keep busy by doing things
        that fill you with meaning and happiness. It doesn’t need to be a big thing: we
        might find meaning in being good parents or in helping our neighbors.</p>
    <p>There is no perfect strategy to connecting with our ikigai. But what we learned
        from the Okinawans is that we should not worry too much about finding it.
    </p>
    <p>Life is not a problem to be solved. Just remember to have something that
        keeps you busy doing what you love while being surrounded by the people who
        love you.</p>
    <h2>The ten rules of ikigai</h2>
    <p>We’ll conclude this journey with ten rules we’ve distilled from the wisdom of the
        long-living residents of Ogimi:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Stay active; don’t retire. Those who give up the things they love doing and
                do well lose their purpose in life. That’s why it’s so important to keep doing
                things of value, making progress, bringing beauty or utility to others, helping
                out, and shaping the world around you, even after your “official” professional
                activity has ended.</b></li>
        <li><b>Take it slow.</b> Being in a hurry is inversely proportional to quality of life. As
            the old saying goes, “Walk slowly and you’ll go far.” When we leave urgency
            behind, life and time take on new meaning.</li>
        <li><b>Don’t fill your stomach.</b> Less is more when it comes to eating for long life,
            too. According to the 80 percent rule, in order to stay healthier longer, we should
            eat a little less than our hunger demands instead of stuffing ourselves.
        </li>
        <li><b>Surround yourself with good friends.</b> Friends are the best medicine,
            there for confiding worries over a good chat, sharing stories that brighten your
            day, getting advice, having fun, dreaming . . . in other words, living.</li>
        <li><b>Get in shape for your next birthday.</b> Water moves; it is at its best when it
            flows fresh and doesn’t stagnate. The body you move through life in needs a bit
            of daily maintenance to keep it running for a long time. Plus, exercise releases
            hormones that make us feel happy.</li>
        <li><b>Smile.</b> A cheerful attitude is not only relaxing—it also helps make friends.
            It’s good to recognize the things that aren’t so great, but we should never forget
            what a privilege it is to be in the here and now in a world so full of possibilities.
        </li>
        <li><b>Reconnect with nature.</b> Though most people live in cities these days,
            human beings are made to be part of the natural world. We should return to it
            often to recharge our batteries.</li>
