        <h2>What is resilience?</h2>
        <p>One thing that everyone with a clearly defined ikigai has in common is that they
            pursue their passion no matter what. They never give up, even when the cards
            seem stacked against them or they face one hurdle after another.
        </p>
        <p>We’re talking about resilience, a concept that has become influential among
            psychologists.
        </p>
        <p>But resilience isn’t just the ability to persevere. As we’ll see in this chapter, it
            is also an outlook we can cultivate to stay focused on the important things in life
            rather than what is most urgent, and to keep ourselves from being carried away by
            negative emotions.</p>
        <p>In the final section of the chapter, we’ll explore techniques that go beyond
            resilience to cultivate antifragility.
        </p>
        <p>Sooner or later, we all have to face difficult moments, and the way we do this
            can make a huge difference to our quality of life. Proper training for our mind,
            body, and emotional resilience is essential for confronting life’s ups and downs.

        <blockquote>
            Nana korobi ya oki 七転び八起き
            Fall seven times, rise eight.
            —Japanese proverb
        </blockquote>
        <p>Resilience is our ability to deal with setbacks. The more resilient we are, the
            easier it will be to pick ourselves up and get back to what gives meaning to our
            lives.
        </p>
        <p>Resilient people know how to stay focused on their objectives, on what
            matters, without giving in to discouragement. Their flexibility is the source of
            their strength: They know how to adapt to change and to reversals of fortune.
            They concentrate on the things they can control and don’t worry about those they
            can’t.</p>
        <p>In the words of the famous Serenity Prayer by Reinhold Niebuhr:</p>
        <p><em>God, give us grace to accept with serenity <br>
                the things that cannot be changed, <br>
                Courage to change the things <br>
                which should be changed, <br>
                and the Wisdom to distinguish <br>
                the one from the other. <br>
                the one from the other.
            </em></p>
        <h2>Emotional resilience through Buddhism and Stoicism</h2>
        <p>Siddhārtha Gautama (Buddha) was born a prince of Kapilavastu, Nepal, and grew
            up in a palace, surrounded by riches. At sixteen he married and had a child.</p>
        <p>Not satisfied by his family’s wealth, at twenty-nine he decided to try a
            different lifestyle and ran away from the palace to live as an ascetic. But it wasn’t
            asceticism that he was looking for; it didn’t offer the happiness and well-being he
            sought. Neither wealth nor extreme asceticism worked for him. He realized that a
            wise person should not ignore life’s pleasures. A wise person can live with these
            pleasures but should always remain conscious of how easy it is to be enslaved by
            them.</p>
        <p>Zeno of Citium began his studies with the Cynics. The Cynics also led ascetic
            lives, leaving behind all earthly pleasures. They lived in the street, and the only
            thing they owned was the clothing on their backs.</p>
        <p>Seeing that Cynicism did not give him a sense of well-being, Zeno abandoned
            its teachings to found the school of Stoicism, which centers on the idea that there
            is nothing wrong with enjoying life’s pleasures as long as they do not take control
            of your life as you enjoy them. You have to be prepared for those pleasures to
            disappear.</p>
        <p>The goal is not to eliminate all feelings and pleasures from our lives, as in
            Cynicism, but to eliminate negative emotions.
        </p>
        <p>Since their inception, one of the objectives of both Buddhism and Stoicism
            has been to control pleasure, emotions, and desires. Though the philosophies are
            very different, both aim to curb our ego and control our negative emotions.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Both Stoicism and Buddhism are, at their roots, methods for practicing wellbeing.
            According to Stoicism, our pleasures and desires are not the problem. We can
            enjoy them as long as they don’t take control of us. The Stoics viewed those who
            were able to control their emotions as virtuous.
