        <h2>Going with the flow
        </h2>
        <p>Imagine you are skiing down one of your favorite slopes. Powdery snow flies up
            on both sides of you like white sand. Conditions are perfect.
        </p>
        <p>You are entirely focused on skiing as well as you can. You know exactly how
            to move at each moment. <i>There is no future, no past. There is only the present.</i>
            You feel the snow, your skis, your body, and your consciousness united as a
            single entity. <i>You are completely immersed in the experience, not thinking about or
                distracted by anything else.</i> Your ego dissolves, and you become part of what you
            are doing.
        </p>
        <p>This is the kind of experience Bruce Lee described with his famous “Be water,
            my friend.”</p>
        <p>We’ve all felt our sense of time vanish when we lose ourselves in an activity
            we enjoy. We start cooking and before we know it, several hours have passed.
            We spend an afternoon with a book and forget about the world going by until we
            notice the sunset and realize we haven’t eaten dinner. We go surfing and don’t
            realize how many hours we have spent in the water until the next day, when our
            muscles ache.
        </p>
        <p>The funny thing is that someone else might really enjoy the same task, but we
            want to finish as quickly as possible.
        </p>
        <p>What makes us enjoy doing something so much that we forget about whatever
            worries we might have while we do it? When are we happiest? These questions
            can help us discover our <i>ikigai</i>.</p>
        <h2>The power of flow</h2>
        <p>These questions are also at the heart of psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi’s
            research into the experience of being completely immersed in what we are doing.
            Csikszentmihalyi called this state “flow,” and described it as the pleasure, delight,
            creativity, and process when we are completely immersed in life.
        </p>
        <p>There is no magic recipe for finding happiness, for living according to your
            ikigai, but one key ingredient is the ability to reach this state of flow and, through
            this state, to have an “optimal experience.”</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this optimal experience, we have to focus on increasing the
            time we spend on activities that bring us to this state of flow, rather than allowing
            ourselves to get caught up in activities that offer immediate pleasure—like eating
            too much, abusing drugs or alcohol, or stuffing ourselves with chocolate in front
            of the TV.</p>
        <p>As Csikszentmihalyi asserts in his book Flow: The Psychology of Optimal
            Experience, flow is “the state in which people are so involved in an activity that
            nothing else seems to matter; the experience itself is so enjoyable that people will
            do it even at great cost, for the sheer sake of doing it.”</p>
        <p>It is not only creative professionals who require the high doses of
            concentration that promote flow. Most athletes, chess players, and engineers also
            spend much of their time on activities that bring them to this state.
        </p>
        <p>According to Csikszentmihalyi’s research, a chess player feels the same way
            upon entering a state of flow as a mathematician working on a formula or a
            surgeon performing an operation. A professor of psychology, Csikszentmihalyi
            analyzed data from people around the world and discovered that flow is the same
            among individuals of all ages and cultures. In New York and Okinawa, we all
            reach a state of flow in the same way.
        </p>
        <p>But what happens to our mind when we are in that state?</p>
        <p>When we flow, we are focused on a concrete task without any distractions.
            Our mind is “in order.” The opposite occurs when we try to do something while
            our mind is on other things.</p>
        <p>If you often find yourself losing focus while working on something you
            consider important, there are several strategies you can employ to increase your
            chances of achieving flow.</p>
