    <p>TO GET TO Ogimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months
        earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the
        purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous
        conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the
        town.

    <p>TO GET TO Ogimi, we had to fly nearly three hours from Tokyo to Naha, the capital of Okinawa. Several months
        earlier we had contacted the town council of a place known as the Village of Longevity to explain the
        purpose of our trip and our intention to interview the oldest members of the community. After numerous
        conversations, we finally got the help we were looking for and were able to rent a house just outside the
        town.
    </p>
    <p>We realized right away that time seems to have stopped there, as though the
        entire town were living in an endless here and now.
    </p>
    <h2>Arriving in Ogimi</h2>
    <p>After two hours on the road from Naha, we’re finally able to stop worrying about
        the traffic. To our left are the sea and an empty stretch of beach; to our right, the
        mountainous jungle of Okinawa’s Yanbaru forests.
    </p>
    <p>Once Route 58 passes Nago, where Orion beer—the pride of Okinawa—is
        made, it skirts the coast until it reaches Ogimi. Every now and then a few little
        houses and stores crop up in the narrow stretch of land between the road and the
        base of the mountain.</p>
    <p>We pass small clusters of houses scattered here and there as we enter the
        municipality of Ogimi, but the town doesn’t really seem to have a center. Our
        GPS finally guides us to our destination: the Center for the Support and
        Promotion of Well-Being, housed in an unattractive cinderblock building right
        off the highway.</p>
    <p>We go in through the back door, where a man named Taira is waiting for us.
        Beside him is a petite, cheerful woman who introduces herself as Yuki. Two
        other women immediately get up from desks and show us to a conference room.
        They serve us each a cup of green tea and a few shikuwasa, a small citrus fruit
        that packs a big nutritional punch, as we will see later on.
    </p>
    <p>Taira sits down across from us in his formal suit and opens up a large planner
        and a three-ring binder. Yuki sits next to him. The binder contains a list of all the
        town’s residents, organized by age and “club,” or moai. Taira points out that these
        groups of people who help one another are characteristic of Ogimi. The moai are
        not organized around any concrete objective; they function more like a family.
        Taira also tells us that volunteer work, rather than money, drives much of what
        happens in Ogimi. Everyone offers to pitch in, and the local government takes
        care of assigning tasks. This way, everyone can be useful and feels like a part of
        the community.</p>
    <p>Ogimi is the penultimate town before Cape Hedo, the northernmost point of
        the largest island in the archipelago.
    </p>
    <p>From the top of one of Ogimi’s mountains, we’re able to look down over the
        whole town. Almost everything is the green of the Yanbaru jungle, making us
        wonder where the nearly thirty-two hundred residents are hiding. We can see a
        few houses, but they’re scattered in little clusters near the sea or in small valleys
        accessible by side roads.
    </p>
    <h2>Communal life
    </h2>
    <p>We’re invited to eat in one of Ogimi’s few restaurants, but when we arrive the
        only three tables are already reserved.
    </p>
    <p>“Don’t worry, we’ll go to Churaumi instead. It never fills up,” says Yuki,
        walking back to her car.
    </p>
    <p>She’s still driving at age eighty-eight, and takes great pride in that. Her copilot
        is ninety-nine, and has also decided to spend the day with us. We have to drive
        fast to keep up with them on a highway that is sometimes more dirt than asphalt.
        Finally reaching the other end of the jungle, we can at last sit down to eat.
    </p>
    <p>“I don’t really go to restaurants,” Yuki says as we take our seats. “Almost
        everything I eat comes from my vegetable garden, and I buy my fish from
        Tanaka, who’s been my friend forever."</p>
    <p>The restaurant is right by the sea and seems like something from the planet
        Tatooine, from Star Wars. The menu boasts in large letters that it serves “slow
        food” prepared with organic vegetables grown in the town.
    </p>
    <p>“But really,” Yuki continues, “food is the least important thing.” She is
        extroverted, and rather pretty. She likes to talk about her role as the director of
        several associations run by the local government.</p>
    <p>“Food won’t help you live longer,” she says, bringing to her lips a bite of the
        diminutive confection that followed our meal. “The secret is smiling and having a
        good time.”</p>
    <p>There are no bars and only a few restaurants in Ogimi, but those who live
        there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is
        there enjoy a rich social life that revolves around community centers. The town is
        divided into seventeen neighborhoods, and each one has a president and several
        people in charge of things like culture, festivals, social activities, and longevity.</p>
    <p>Residents pay close attention to this last category.
    </p>
    <p>We’re invited to the community center of one of the seventeen neighborhoods.
        It is an old building right next to one of the mountains of the Yanbaru jungle,
        home to bunagaya, the town’s iconic sprites.</p>
