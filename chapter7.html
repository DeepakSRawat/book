    <h2>THE IKIGAI DIET</h2>
    <h1>What the world’s longest-living
        people eat and drink
    </h1>
    <p>ACCORDING TO THEWorld Health Organization, Japan has the highest life expectancy in the world: 85 years for
        men and 87.3 years for women. Moreover, it has the highest ratio of centenarians in the world: more than
        520 for every million people (as of September 2016).

    <p>The above graphic, which compares life expectancy in Japan, its province
        Okinawa, Sweden, and the United States, shows that, while life expectancy in
        Japan is high overall, Okinawa exceeds the national average.
    </p>
    <p>Okinawa is one of the areas in Japan that were most affected by World War II.
        As a result not only of conflicts on the battlefield but also of hunger and a lack of
        resources once the war ended, the average life expectancy was not very high
        during the 1940s and 1950s. As Okinawans recovered from the destruction,
        however, they came to be some of the country’s longest-living citizens.</p>

        of life expectancy?
    </p>
    <p>Experts point out that, for one thing, Okinawa is the only province in Japan
        without trains. Its residents have to walk or cycle when not driving. It is also the
        only province that has managed to follow the Japanese government’s
        recommendation of eating less than ten grams of salt per day.

    <h2>Okinawa’s miracle diet</h2>
    <p>The mortality rate from cardiovascular disease in Okinawa is the lowest in Japan,
        and diet almost certainly has a lot to do with this. It is no coincidence that the
        “Okinawa Diet” is so often discussed around the world at panels on nutrition.</p>
    <p>The most concrete and widely cited data on diet in Okinawa come from
        studies by Makoto Suzuki, a cardiologist at the University of the Ryukyus, who
        has published more than seven hundred scientific articles on nutrition and aging
        in Okinawa since 1970.</p>
    <p>Bradley J. Willcox and D. Craig Willcox joined Makoto Suzuki’s research
        team and published a book considered the bible on the subject, The Okinawa
        Program.
        1 They reached the following conclusions:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Locals eat a wide variety of foods, especially vegetables. Variety seems to be
            key. A study of Okinawa’s centenarians showed that they ate 206 different
            foods, including spices, on a regular basis. They ate an average of eighteen
            different foods each day, a striking contrast to the nutritional poverty of our
            fast-food culture.</li>
        <li>They eat at least five servings of fruits and vegetables every day. At least
            seven types of fruits and vegetables are consumed by Okinawans on a daily
            basis. The easiest way to check if there is enough variety on your table is to
            make sure you’re “eating the rainbow.” A table featuring red peppers,
            carrots, spinach, cauliflower, and eggplant, for example, offers great color
            and variety. Vegetables, potatoes, legumes, and soy products such as tofu are
            the staples of an Okinawan’s diet. More than 30 percent of their daily
            calories comes from vegetables.</li>
        <li>Grains are the foundation of their diet. Japanese people eat white rice every
            day, sometimes adding noodles. Rice is the primary food in Okinawa, as
            well.
        </li>
        <li>They rarely eat sugar, and if they do, it’s cane sugar. We drove through
            several sugarcane fields every morning on our way to Ogimi, and even drank
            a glass of cane juice at Nakijin Castle. Beside the stall selling the juice was a
            sign describing the anticarcinogenic benefits of sugarcane.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these basic dietary principles, Okinawans eat fish an average of
        three times per week; unlike in other parts of Japan, the most frequently
        consumed meat is pork, though locals eat it only once or twice per week.
        Along these lines, Makoto Suzuki’s studies indicate the following:
    </p>
    <li>Okinawans consume, in general, one-third as much sugar as the rest of
        Japan’s population, which means that sweets and chocolate are much less a
        part of their diet.
