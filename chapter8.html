        <main>The Japanese government has long been a proponent of the concept of Kigai, or "the Japanese secret to a
            long and happy life."
            Kigai is a Japanese concept that suggests that the most important thing in life is to live simply and to
            move
            with the flow of the universe. This philosophy is rooted in the belief that the body, as well as the mind,
            can be
            rejuvenated and recharged
            <p>STUDIES FROM THEBlue Zones suggest that the people who live longest are not the ones who do the most
                exercise
                but rather the ones who move the most.</p>
            <p>When we visited Ogimi, the Village of Longevity, we discovered that even
                people over eighty and ninety years old are still highly active. They don’t stay at
                home looking out the window or reading the newspaper. Ogimi’s residents walk a
                lot, do karaoke with their neighbors, get up early in the morning, and, as soon as
                they’ve had breakfast—or even before—head outside to weed their gardens. They
                don’t go to the gym or exercise intensely, but they almost never stop moving in
                the course of their daily routines.

                <b>As Easy as Getting out of Your Chair</b>
                <p>“Metabolism slows down 90 percent after 30 minutes of sitting. The
                    enzymes that move the bad fat from your arteries to your muscles, where
                    it can get burned off, slow down. And after two hours, good cholesterol
                    drops 20 percent. Just getting up for five minutes is going to get things
                    going again. These things are so simple they’re almost stupid,” says Gavin
                    Bradley
                    1
                    in a 2015 interview with Brigid Schulte for the Washington Post.

                    Bradley is one of the preeminent experts on the subject, and the director
                    of an international organization dedicated to building awareness of how
                    detrimental sitting all the time can be to our health.

            <p>If we live in a city, we might find it hard to move in natural and healthy ways
                every day, but we can turn to exercises that have proven for centuries to be good
                for the body.</p>
            <p>The Eastern disciplines for bringing body, mind, and soul into balance have
                become quite popular in the West, but in their countries of origin they have been
                used for ages to promote health.</p>
            <p>Yoga—originally from India, though very popular in Japan—and China’s
                qigong and tai chi, among other disciplines, seek to create harmony between a
                person’s body and mind so they can face the world with strength, joy, and
                serenity.</p>
            <p>They are touted as elixirs of youth, and science has endorsed the claim.
            </p>
            <p>These gentle exercises offer extraordinary health benefits, and are particularly
                appropriate for older individuals who have a harder time staying fit.</p>
            <p>Tai chi has been shown, among other things, to slow the development of
                osteoporosis and Parkinson’s disease, to increase circulation, and to improve
                muscle tone and flexibility. Its emotional benefits are just as important: It is a
                great shield against stress and depression.</p>
            <p>You don’t need to go to the gym for an hour every day or run marathons. As
                Japanese centenarians show us, all you need is to add movement to your day.
                Practicing any of these Eastern disciplines on a regular basis is a great way to do
                so. An added benefit is that they all have well-defined steps, and as we saw in
                chapter IV, disciplines with clear rules are good for flow. If you don’t like any of
                these disciplines, feel free to choose a practice that you love and that makes you
                move.
            </p>
            <p>In the following pages we’ll take a look at some of the practices that promote
                health and longevity—but first, a little appetizer: a singularly Japanese exercise
                for starting your day.</p>
            <h2>Radio taiso</h2>
            <p>This morning warm-up has been around since before World War II. The “radio”
                part of its name is from when the instructions for each exercise were transmitted
                over the radio, but today people usually do these movements while tuned to a
                television channel or Internet video demonstrating the steps.
            </p>
            <p>One of the main purposes of doing radio taiso is to promote a spirit of unity
                among participants. The exercises are always done in groups, usually in schools
                before the start of classes, and in businesses before the workday begins.
            </p>
            <p>Statistics show that 30 percent of Japanese practice radio taiso for a few
                minutes every morning, but radio taiso is one thing that almost everyone we
                interviewed in Ogimi had in common. Even the residents of the nursing home we
                visited dedicated at least five minutes every day to it, though some did the
                exercises from their wheelchairs. We joined them on their daily practice and we
                felt refreshed for the rest of the day.</p>
            <p>When these exercises are done in a group, it is usually on a sports field or in a
                large reception hall, and typically involves some kind of loudspeaker.</p>
            <p>The exercises take five or ten minutes, depending on whether you do all or
                only some of them. They focus on dynamic stretching and increasing joint
                mobility. One of the most iconic radio taiso exercises consists of simply raising
                your arms above your head and then bringing them down in a circular motion. It
                is a tool to wake up the body, an easy mobility workout that is low in intensity
                and that focuses on exercising as many joints as possible.
            </p>
            <p>It might seem basic, but in our modern lives, we can spend days without
                raising our arms above our ears. Think about it: our arms are down when using
                computers, when using smartphones, when reading books. One of the few times
                we raise our hands over our heads is when reaching for something in a cupboard
                or closet, while our ancestors were raising their hands over their heads all the
                time when gathering things from trees. Radio taiso helps us to practice all the
                basic movements of the body.</p>
