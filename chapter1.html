    <h1>The art of staying young while growing old</h1>
    <h2>What is your reason for being?
    </h2>
    <p>According to the Japanese, everyone has an ikigai—what a French philosopher
        might call a raison d’être. Some people have found their ikigai, while others are
        still looking, though they carry it within them.
    </p>
    <p>Our ikigai is hidden deep inside each of us, and finding it requires a patient
        search. According to those born on Okinawa, the island with the most
        centenarians in the world, our ikigai is the reason we get up in the morning.

    <h2>Whatever you do, don’t retire!</h2>
    <p>Having a clearly defined ikigai brings satisfaction, happiness, and meaning to our
        lives. The purpose of this book is to help you find yours, and to share insights
        from Japanese philosophy on the lasting health of body, mind, and spirit.</p>
    <p>One surprising thing you notice, living in Japan, is how active people remain
        after they retire. In fact, many Japanese people never really retire—they keep
        doing what they love for as long as their health allows.</p>
    <p>There is, in fact, no word in Japanese that means retire in the sense of “leaving
        the workforce for good” as in English. According to Dan Buettner, a National
        Geographic reporter who knows the country well, having a purpose in life is so
        important in Japanese culture that our idea of retirement simply doesn’t exist
        there.</p>

    <h2>The island of (almost) eternal youth</h2>
    <P>Certain longevity studies suggest that a strong sense of community and a clearly
        defined ikigai are just as important as the famously healthful Japanese diet—
        perhaps even more so. Recent medical studies of centenarians from Okinawa and
        other so-called Blue Zones—the geographic regions where people live longest—
        provide a number of interesting facts about these extraordinary human beings:
    </P>
    <ul>
        <li>Not only do they live much longer than the rest of the world’s population,
            they also suffer from fewer chronic illnesses such as cancer and heart
            disease; inflammatory disorders are also less common.</li>
        <li>Many of these centenarians enjoy enviable levels of vitality and health that
            would be unthinkable for people of advanced age elsewhere.
        </li>
        <li>Their blood tests reveal fewer free radicals (which are responsible for
            cellular aging), as a result of drinking tea and eating until their stomachs are
            only 80 percent full.
        </li>
        <li>Women experience more moderate symptoms during menopause, and both
            men and women maintain higher levels of sexual hormones until much later
            in life.</li>
        <li>The rate of dementia is well below the global average.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <p>
            <bold>The Characters Behind Ikigai</bold>
        </p>
        <p>In Japanese, ikigai is written as 生き甲斐, combining 生き, which means
            “life,” with 甲斐, which means “to be worthwhile.” 甲斐 can be broken
            down into the characters 甲, which means “armor,” “number one,” and “to
            be the first” (to head into battle, taking initiative as a leader), and 斐,
            which means “beautiful” or “elegant.”</p>
    </div>
    <p>Though we will consider each of these findings over the course of the book,
        research clearly indicates that the Okinawans’ focus on ikigai gives a sense of
        purpose to each and every day and plays an important role in their health and
        longevity.</p>
    <h2>The five Blue Zones</h2>
    <p>Okinawa holds first place among the world’s Blue Zones. In Okinawa, women in
        particular live longer and have fewer diseases than anywhere else in the world.
        The five regions identified and analyzed by Dan Buettner in his book The Blue
        Zones are:
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Okinawa, Japan (especially the northern part of the island). The locals eat a
            diet rich in vegetables and tofu typically served on small plates. In addition to
            their philosophy of ikigai, the moai, or close-knit group of friends (see page
            15), plays an important role in their longevity.</li>
        <li>Sardinia, Italy (specifically the provinces of Nuoro and Ogliastra). Locals on
            this island consume plenty of vegetables and one or two glasses of wine per
            day. As in Okinawa, the cohesive nature of this community is another factor
            directly related to longevity.
        </li>
        <li>Loma Linda, California. Researchers studied a group of Seventh-day
            Adventists who are among the longest-living people in the United States.
        </li>
        <li>The Nicoya Peninsula, Costa Rica. Locals remain remarkably active after
            ninety; many of the region’s older residents have no problem getting up at
            five thirty in the morning to work in the fields.
        </li>
        <li>Ikaria, Greece. One of every three inhabitants of this island near the coast of
            Turkey is over ninety years old (compared to less than 1 percent of the
            population of the United States), a fact that has earned it the nickname the
            Island of Long Life. The local secret seems to be a lifestyle that dates back to
            500 BC.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the following chapters, we will examine several factors that seem to be the
        keys to longevity and are found across the Blue Zones, paying special attention to
        Okinawa and its so-called Village of Longevity. First, however, it is worth
        pointing out that three of these regions are islands, where resources can be scarce
        and communities have to help one another.
    </p>
    <p>For many, helping others might be an ikigai strong enough to keep them alive.
        According to scientists who have studied the five Blue Zones, the keys to
        longevity are diet, exercise, finding a purpose in life (an ikigai), and forming
        strong social ties—that is, having a broad circle of friends and good family
        relations.</p>
    <p>Members of these communities manage their time well in order to reduce
        stress, consume little meat or processed foods, and drink alcohol in moderation.</p>
    <h2>The 80 percent secret
    </h2>
    <p>One of the most common sayings in Japan is “Hara hachi bu,” which is repeated
        before or after eating and means something like “Fill your belly to 80 percent.”
        Ancient wisdom advises against eating until we are full. This is why Okinawans
        stop eating when they feel their stomachs reach 80 percent of their capacity,
        rather than overeating and wearing down their bodies with long digestive
        processes that accelerate cellular oxidation.
    </p>
    <p>Of course, there is no way to know objectively if your stomach is at 80
        percent capacity. The lesson to learn from this saying is that we should stop eating
        when we are starting to feel full. The extra side dish, the snack we eat when we
        know in our hearts we don’t really need it, the apple pie after lunch—all these will
        give us pleasure in the short term, but not having them will make us happier in
        the long term.</p>
    <p>The way food is served is also important. By presenting their meals on many
        small plates, the Japanese tend to eat less. A typical meal in a restaurant in Japan
        is served in five plates on a tray, four of them very small and the main dish
        slightly bigger. Having five plates in front of you makes it seem like you are
        going to eat a lot, but what happens most of the time is that you end up feeling
        slightly hungry. This is one of the reasons why Westerners in Japan typically lose
        weight and stay trim.
    </p>
    <p>Recent studies by nutritionists reveal that Okinawans consume a daily average
        of 1,800 to 1,900 calories, compared to 2,200 to 3,300 in the United States, and
        have a body mass index between 18 and 22, compared to 26 or 27 in the United
        States.
    </p>
    <p>The Okinawan diet is rich in tofu, sweet potatoes, fish (three times per week),
        and vegetables (roughly 11 ounces per day). In the chapter dedicated to nutrition
        we will see which healthy, antioxidant-rich foods are included in this 80 percent.</p>
    <h2>Moai: Connected for life
    </h2>
    <p>It is customary in Okinawa to form close bonds within local communities. A moai
        is an informal group of people with common interests who look out for one
        another. For many, serving the community becomes part of their ikigai.
    </p>
    <p>The moai has its origins in hard times, when farmers would get together to
        share best practices and help one another cope with meager harvests.
    </p>
    <p>Members of a moai make a set monthly contribution to the group. This
        payment allows them to participate in meetings, dinners, games of go and shogi
        (Japanese chess), or whatever hobby they have in common.
    </p>
    <p>The funds collected by the group are used for activities, but if there is money
        left over, one member (decided on a rotating basis) receives a set amount from
        the surplus. In this way, being part of a moai helps maintain emotional and
        financial stability. If a member of a moai is in financial trouble, he or she can get
        an advance from the group’s savings. While the details of each moai’s accounting
        practices vary according to the group and its economic means, the feeling of
        belonging and support gives the individual a sense of security and helps increase
        life expectancy.
    </p>
    <p>FOLLOWING THIS BRIEF introduction to the topics covered in this book, we look at
        a few causes of premature aging in modern life, and then explore different
        factors related to ikigai.
